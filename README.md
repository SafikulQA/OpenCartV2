# OpenCartV2
This repository contains an automation testing Project for the OpenCart eCommerce application. The test suite is developed using Java, Selenium WebDriver, and the TestNG framework to ensure the core functionalities of OpenCart work as expected. It includes automated test cases for essential user flows such as Account Registration, Login and Data-Driven Testing, Search Product, Add to Cart Page and End to End Test to validate multiple input scenarios. The framework follows a modular and scalable approach, making it easy to maintain and expand.
To manage dependencies and build the project, Maven is integrated, allowing smooth test execution from the command line using test suite XML files like master.xml, grouping.xml, and crossbrowser.xml. These XML files are used to control and organize test executions based on full suite runs, test groupings, or cross-browser validations. TestNG annotations and features such as grouping and parallel execution help in managing test cases efficiently and generating structured reports.
The project is also integrated with Jenkins to support Continuous Integration (CI), enabling automated test runs after each code push or scheduled intervals. This helps in identifying issues early in the development cycle. Git is used for version control to keep track of code changes, collaborate with team members, and push the code to GitHub.
This automation suite is ideal for QA teams looking to validate the stability of OpenCart features continuously. The project can be easily set up by cloning the repository, running Maven commands, and executing the desired XML test suite. The framework supports test scalability, maintainability, and multi-browser compatibility, making it a robust solution for eCommerce application testing.
